# Bus Stop Cafe 2.0
We set out to find a solution for children who cannot get meals during the summer and cannot get to Summer Food Service Program locations. We found that Indianapolis Public Schools already had a "Bus Stop Cafe" going to the Startford Apartment Complex and has been very successful, so it seems logical on expanding that program. We used Tableau to do some beginning data analysis on where additional bus stops/routes could be. We also used XCode to outline potential functionality that could be integrated into the existing IPS app or become a standalone app. Those ideas could be transferred to the IPS website as well.
